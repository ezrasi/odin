    <ul>
      <li>4 tablespoons (56g) vegan butter, softened at room temp </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons (30-35g) white miso paste, softened at room temp (note 1) </li>
      <li>20 ounces (570g) mixed mushrooms, sliced or torn (note 2) </li>
      <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh thyme leaves</li>
      <li>6 garlic cloves minced and divided in half</li>
      <li>6 to 8 cups (1.5 to 1.9 L) vegetable broth (note 3) </li>
      <li>2 large leeks (white & light green parts only), cleaned and diced (note 4) </li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>Freshly cracked black pepper </li>
      <li>2 cups (~370g) Carnaroli rice or Arborio rice</li>
      <li>2/3 cup (160 mL) dry white wine (note 5) </li>
      <li>1/4 cup (30g) vegan parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
      <li>1 handful Italian flat-leaf parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Read the recipe notes below before starting!</strong> </li>
      <br>
      <li>Take the vegan butter and miso out of the fridge and place in a small bowl to soften. Once softened, use a fork to cream them together until well combined. </li>
      <br>
      <li>Add the <strongg>vegetable broth </strong>to a saucepan. Once it comes to a rapid simmer, adjust the heat to keep the broth warm/hot at a gentle simmer. </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Cook the mushrooms.</strong>Heat a large frying pan over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil (if using stainless steel or cast iron, use more oil). <br>Once the oil is shimmering, add the mushrooms. Cook undisturbed for a few minutes to develop some browning. Cook for a total of 8 to 9 minutes, until nicely browned, stirring only occasionally.   </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Reduce the heat to medium.</strong> Add the chopped <strong>thyme</strong> and 
      <strong>HALF of the minced garlic</strong> to the mushrooms. Season with 1/2 teaspoon
      kosher salt. Cook for 2 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent burning. <br>
      Add the <strong>creamed miso butter</strong> and stir into the mushrooms, stirring frequently to coat the mushrooms for 2 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Set aside. </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Cook the risotto.</strong> Heat a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed deep sauté pan over medium heat (note 6). Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Once hot, add the 
      <strong>leeks</strong> and <strong>remaining garlic.</strong> Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until the leeks have just softened. </li>
      <br>
      <li>Add the <strong>rice</strong> and stir quickly until all the grains are well-coated and the rice smells slightly toasty, 60 to 90 seconds. 
      <br> Pour in the <strong>wine,</strong> and stir to scrape any bits stuck to the bottom of the pot, cooking until the wine is nearly evaporated and the smell of booze has dissipated, about 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Ladle in <strong>1 cup (240 mL) of warm vegetable broth </strong>and stir frequently but not constantly. Once the rice has absorbed the liquid, add the next round of broth, 1 cup at a time. <br>
      Continue this process <strong>stirring about every 30 seconds </strong>and adding more broth when most of the liquid has been absorbed. <br>
      It should take <strong>about 20 minutes</strong> from the time you add the first ladle of broth, or until the risotto is slightly firm and creamy, but not too soft or mushy. </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>To test for doneness: </strong>you can place the rice on a flat surface and smear downwards with your finger. It should be fairly smooth but you should still be able to see a bit of the white, al dente center of the rice. (note 7). </li>
      <br>
      <li>Add cooked mushrooms to the risotto, and stir to warm through. <br>
      Remove from the heat, and stir in vegan parmesan, if using. Taste for seasonings, adding salt and pepper as needed. Garnish with chopped parsley and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>White miso can be found at well-stocked grocery stores and Asian markets. If using a darker miso, like red miso, use less as it’s stronger. </li>
      <br>
      <li>Mushroom varieties I like: cremini (inexpensive) + 2 to 3 fancier varieties, like oyster, maitake, shiitake, king oyster, beech, and chanterelle. </li>
      <br>
      <li>Heat 8 cups broth to be safe, but you may not use the entire amount. My favorite store-bought veggie broth is Organic Imagine. </li>
      <br>
      <li>To clean leeks, peel away papery outer layers, then dice. Add to a bowl of cold water and swish the leeks around with your hands. Scoop the leeks out with your hands or a slotted spoon and dry on towels. </li>

      <br>
      <li> To omit the wine, skip to adding the veggie broth. OR, add a splash of white wine vinegar at any stage when ladling in the broth. </li>
      <br>
      <li>When using a Dutch oven or similar pan, you need to use a bit more oil and elbow grease to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot. If you use use the same pan to cook the mushrooms and the risotto, be sure to clean it out after frying the mushrooms and before cooking the risotto.  </li>
