    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Chili:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced or pressed</li>
        <li>2 cans (28 oz/796 ml each) diced tomatoes, (6 ¬Ω cups)</li>
        <li>1 can (19 oz/ 540 ml) black beans, drained and rinsed (or 2 cups cooked beans)</li>
        <li>1 can (19 oz/ 540 ml) kidney beans, drained and rinsed (or 2 cups cooked beans)</li>
        <li>1 cup water, (plus more if needed)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cumin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>¬º - ¬Ω teaspoon cayenne powder, (optional for spice)</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>For the Meaty Tofu Crumbles:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce, (gluten-free if preferred)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 block (12 oz/ 350 g) extra-firm tofu, drained (no need to press it)</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>For the Chili: </strong>Add the olive oil to a large pot and heat over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic and saut√© until the onion is translucent and just begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, beans, water, and all of the spices. Bring to a boil and then reduce to simmer and continue to simmer with the lid off for 1 hour, giving it a stir every now and then. If the chili gets too thick, add water as needed to reach your desired consistency.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>For the Tofu Crumbles: </strong>Preheat your oven to 350‚Ñâ (180‚ÑÉ). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it.</li>
      <br>
      <li>In a large bowl, mix nutritional yeast, soy sauce, and olive oil. Break the tofu into a few large chunks and add them to the bowl, then us a potato masher to mash the tofu into crumbles. Stir the tofu crumbles well making sure all of the tofu is evenly coated in nutritional yeast mix.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Spread the tofu crumbles evenly over the prepared pan. Bake for 40 - 45 minutes, stopping to stir the tofu every now and then. Keep a close eye on it towards the end so that it doesn't burn. You want the tofu to be nicely browned. The smaller crumbles will be darker than the larger crumbles, and that's good because it will provide a variety of texture to the chili. Remove from the oven and set aside.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Once the chili has simmer for an hour, stir in the tofu crumbles into the chili and continue to cook for another 5 minutes. This will allow the tofu to absorb the sauce and become chewy. Serve hot with toppings of choice and a side of cornbread if desired. See notes for storage.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
    <strong>Storage/Freezing: </strong>
    To store chili, let it cool and place it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3-4 days. For longer storage, freeze in freezer safe containers. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight, and reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave, adding liquid if needed to maintain consistency.
